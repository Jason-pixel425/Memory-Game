# Memory Game
Scrimba React memory game

The Scrimba tutorial built the application with vanilla React and JavaScript. 
Having just learnt TypeScript - also through Scrimba - I decided to implement TypeScript. 

I learnt alot more about TypeScript, and gained greater appreciation for how TypeScript helps prevent errors before runtime.

Built with TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and React.
